    <h1>Career Goals</h1>
    <div class="user-projects">   
          <p>I am currently seeking a biomedical engineering internship or co-op for 2021, specializing in electronic systems or sensors
              in order to utilize my electrical engineering degree. I am open to relocation and multiple rotations. Feel free to contact 
              me via email or LinkedIn.
          <p>When I was young, I was always fascinated with medicine. In high school, I grew to love math and science, 
            eventually following a path in engineering. Over time, I developed a passion for working with teams of
            people and utilizing critical thinking skills. I hope to work in medical technology and engineering in the future
            as part of a leadership development program. I have previously flourished as part of large scale teams with tight deadlines. 
            I've let my curiosity guide my passion and determination for working in biomedical engineering and hope it is reflected
             through my previous experiences.</p>
          <p>I believe in the importance of communication and interdisciplinary work. This is reflected through my interpersonal 
            based campus engagements such as Student Leadership Advocates and College of Engineering Ambassadors. I've previously
            worked on interdisciplinary project teams of different backgrounds through my research lab and work at Proctor and 
            Gamble as well. The best ideas can come from a group of people with different backgrounds that are passionate about 
            the work they are doing.</p>
